In a #double boiler{}, gently melt the @coconut oil{1/4%cup}, @shea butter{1/4%cup}, and @beeswax{1%tbsp}. Stir continuously until well combined.
Remove the double boiler from heat. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. While wearing a #mask, slowly add the @zinc oxide powder{2%tnsp}, whisking vigorously to prevent clumping and ensure even distribution.
Add the @jojoba oil{2%tbsp} and @vitamin E oil{1%tbsp} to the mixture. If using, also add the @chamomile or @calendula extract{}. These ingredients are great for soothing and repairing dry, sensitive skin.

Once cooled, cap the container tightly and store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
